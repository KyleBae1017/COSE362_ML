# COSE362_ML

In this project, I tried to predict success/failure of shooting in basketball with 2014-2015 season NBA shooting logs and player stat data.

I tried \
| **Data preprocessing & EDA** with raw data \
| **Feature engineering** with stat data \
| **Logistic regression / XGBoost / Random Forest / MLP** \
| **Model Ensemble**
